## Agenda Items

1. Scheduling meeting with TA/professor.
2. Setting up the bot script to ensure it can run and develop further.
3. Discussing Docker and containerization setup for bot script testing.
4. Repository organization and task planning for ongoing development.

## Discussion Items

### Scheduling Meetings

- We discussed the need to reschedule meetings with the professor/TA for clarification on grades and feedback. We decided to meet a TA on November 1st.

### Bot Script Development and Testing

- We reviewed steps to initiate the bot script and agreed to develop locally first, with Dockerization as a secondary task.
- Discussions included selecting Puppeteer over Playwright for the bot’s framework.

### Docker and Repository Setup

- Setting up Docker containers for consistent environment testing was agreed upon.
- Teams boilerplate code was recommended for starting Meet bot development. The Zooms bot will require a different approach because it's using the Zoom SDK.
- PNPM is being used instead of NPM for package management for its efficiency.

### Task Planning and Milestones

- Initial tasks involved completing bot script setup and configuration for joining meetings.
- The upcoming milestone is to ensure the bot can exit meetings and upload recordings, tentatively set for next week.
- Jason and Owen took the lead on Dockerizing the bot’s environment, while others will proceed with script writing and testing.
